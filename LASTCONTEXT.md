## Project

**TestMind AI** (`ibm-bob-mcp-agent-guard`) — AI-powered QA agent swarm built on IBM Bob + MCP.  
CLI / package name: `repoguard`. GitHub: https://github.com/agustindiazcano/ibm-bob-mcp-agent-guard

## Session summary

### Session 1 (previous)

| # | Action | Files affected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Initialized git repo, connected to GitHub remote, pushed initial commit | all project files |
| 2 | Created `RUNBOOK.md` | `RUNBOOK.md` |
| 3 | Expanded project tree in `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md` |
| 4 | Added branch-per-phase / verify.py gate rules to `AGENTS.md §11` | `AGENTS.md` |
| 5 | Created `LASTCONTEXT.md` and `PENDING.md` | both |

### Session 2 — Phase 0 completion

| # | Action | Files affected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Fixed `pyproject.toml`: corrected build-backend (`setuptools.build_meta`), set `requires-python = ">=3.10"`, added `playwright` and `pillow` deps | `pyproject.toml` |
| 2 | Added `repoguard-out/` and `**/repoguard-out/` exclusions | `.gitignore`, `.bobignore` |
| 3 | Created `scripts/verify.py` with `phase0` check | `scripts/verify.py` |
| 4 | Installed package with `pip install -e . --no-deps`; confirmed `repoguard --help` shows all 5 subcommands | — |
| 5 | `python scripts/verify.py phase0` → **PASS** | — |
| 6 | Marked all Phase 0 deliverables 🟢 in `PENDING.md` | `PENDING.md` |

### Key decisions made

- `build-backend` was wrong (`setuptools.backends.legacy:build` → `setuptools.build_meta`); fixed.
- `playwright` and `pillow` added as required by AGENTS.md §3 tech stack.
- `scripts/verify.py` is a thin gate script; extend it per phase as work progresses.

### Session 3 — Phase 3 (mutation engine) + Phase 7 (MCP compact responses)

| # | Action | Files affected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Replaced `mutmut`-based `run_mutation()` with own AST engine using `ast.NodeTransformer`; 6 operator classes (comparison, arithmetic, boolean, constants, return None, remove raise); temp-copy isolation with `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`; tempdir cleanup after each mutant | `repoguard_engine/core.py` |
| 2 | Added `repoguard-out/` write logic to `measure_coverage()`, `find_coverage_gaps()`, `run_mutation()`, `compute_risk()` — closes the "contract between agents" gap | `repoguard_engine/core.py` |
| 3 | Added `timeout=` to all `subprocess.run()` calls in `core.py` | `repoguard_engine/core.py` |
| 4 | Added `detail: bool = False` param to all 8 MCP tools; compact/full response split | `repoguard_engine/mcp_server.py` |
| 5 | Updated `AGENTS.md §7` verification table with measured numbers (5 tests, 65.1% coverage, 20.25% mutation 16/79) | `AGENTS.md` |
| 6 | Added `phase3` and `phase7` checks to `scripts/verify.py`; added `timeout=` to all subprocess calls in that file | `scripts/verify.py` |
| 7 | Marked Phase 3 "Determinism" and Phase 7 "Compact responses" 🟢 in `PENDING.md` | `PENDING.md` |
| 8 | Created `phase3-7-plan.md` (plan file for this work) | `phase3-7-plan.md` |

### Key decisions (Session 3)

- **Mutation score**: new AST engine produces 20.25%, 16/79 (not the old mutmut 23.6%, 17/72 — different engine, different mutant count, as expected).
- **demo-repo test count**: only 5 tests pass (not 9 as documented); `AGENTS.md §7` corrected to 5.
- **Coverage**: 65.1% (not 74.5%); corrected in `AGENTS.md §7`.
- **`repoguard fix`** (Phase 9) deferred to its own branch — depends on Phases 4–6 and Bob Shell invocation is unverified.
- **`compute_risk()` formula** is still a stub (coverage gap only, not complexity×churn×detection); deferred to Phase 4.
- `find_coverage_gaps()` signature changed to accept optional `repo_path` for writing `gaps.json` — callers passing only `coverage` still work (default is `None`).

## Current repo state

- Branch: `feat/03-mutation` (ready to PR into `main`)
- Phase 0: 🟢 complete
- Phase 3: 🟢 complete (AST engine deterministic; `repoguard-out/` written)
- Phase 7 "Compact responses": 🟢 complete
- Remaining 🔴 critical-path items: Test Writer subagent, Critic subagent, Publisher subagent, `repoguard fix`, Phase 11 full run

---

## How to resume

1. Read `PENDING.md` for the task list.
2. Run `python scripts/verify.py phase0` and `python scripts/verify.py phase7` to confirm recent work.
3. Run `python scripts/verify.py phase3` from a terminal (takes ~8 min — two full mutation runs).
4. Next critical path items (in order): Test Writer subagent (Phase 8) → Publisher subagent → `repoguard fix` (Phase 9) → Phase 11 full run.
